You decide to contribute to an open source project, by adding a feature to an existing class of the project.
The class uses an underscore at the beginning of names then "camelCase" for private properties such as `_likeThis`,
but you find this odd because you're used to the "snake case" `like_this`.
Which option would you choose for the name of the new private property that you will add?
What could the team in charge of the project do to simplify this choice? 

I would always choose the same style as in the open source project. Code conciseness make review and spotting 
errors way easier. The team could publish a style guide in their repo such that developer can refer to that 
guide and not wasting time in unnecessary stuff like style decisions. 

** SOLUTION: the team can avoid discussions like this by using automated formatting tools. Then they can
just run any contribution through the formatting tool. **
