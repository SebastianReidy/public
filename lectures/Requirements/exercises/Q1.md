Welcome to your new job at SuperQuiz, the trendy app that allows everyone to create and share quizzes!
Your first task is to add a new feature.
Here is a transcript from part of a conversation with a user:

> Hey! So you're the developer of this quiz app?
> The one where I can write questions and answers for my friends?
> I think it's cool, but I can't use it as much as I want to.
> I'm a firefighter, I don't have time for this app during the day,
> and when I come home, I have plenty to do, cook, clean, ...
> When I do these tasks I'm busy, not like when I'm watching TV.
> I don't always have my phone in hand! Sometimes I even forget where I put it.
> Maybe if one could use the app with voice it would work?
> With that, I could create quizzes while cooking!
> Otherwise, I can't use the app much.

Write a user story, in a single sentence using the classical format, that summarizes this conversation:

> As a ... I want to ... So that ...

> As a working **solution: multi-tasking** person, I want the app to be accessible by voice, so that I can use it while doing other tasks that require my hands. 

Your story must contain all necessary information and only that information.
