While working with the Junior Entreprise of your university, a talented web 
developer has to work on a new project with a client who wants a website for 
their company. This is the client's first website and they are not familiar 
with web technology. However, the client is enthusiastic and has lots of
different ideas about how to organize the website.
```

> The client is not familiar with web technology, and has lots of different
> ideas about how to organize the website. Therefore, the requirements are not
> defined upfront, and the chosen workflow should be flexible enough to
> accommodate changes. An agile workflow (such as Scrum) would be suitable for
> this project.

The Volare Space Robotics Challenge was a contest organized by the ASI (Agenzia
Spaziale Italiana) and ESA (European Space Agency). The goal was to make
high-school students design robots that unload cargo from ESA's Automated
Transfer Vehicle, while avoiding objects.
```

> An automated robot that operates in space is a very complex product. The
> requirements of the project are proposed early on and are stable. Since space
> exploration is governed by many laws, the project is subjected to different
> stages of approval at each step. The students are inexperienced. All these
> properties make the Waterfall model suitable for the project.
