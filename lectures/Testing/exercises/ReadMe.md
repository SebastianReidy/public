# Exercises: Testing

**Theoretical exercises**:

- [Q1: Regression Testing](Q1.md)
- [Q2: Code Coverage](Q2.md)
- [Q3: Testable module design](Q3.md)

**Practical exercises**:

- [Q4: Dependency Injection](Q4/)
- [Q5: Test-Driven Development](Q5/)


The [solutions](solutions) are available.


**Ideas for your own projects**:

- Write unit tests for the functions in your code
- Update your code to inject dependencies (e.g an HTTP client), so you can test your modules
- The next time you encounter a bug, start by writing a regression test that reproduces that bug.
- Try test-driven development for your next feature addition
