# Lecture exercises

In preparation for Friday's lecture, we ask you
to [set up your Android Studio environment](Q0.1%20-%20Setup.md) and to run the SwEng App project.

During the lecture, we will go through a few basics of Android development as part of the
[Android Basics](Q0.2%20-%20Android%20Basics.md) exercise.
