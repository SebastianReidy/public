The company you're working in recently hired a new CEO, who wants to improve development using modern methods.
However, this CEO does not have an engineering background, so his suggestions are well-intentioned but not always feasible.

The CEO comes to you with a new suggestion:

> Continuous integration is a good practice. We must adopt it, so that our code never has bugs.
> All branches in all our repositories must use continuous integration, and at the end of each day all branches must pass continuous integration.

Explain to the CEO (1) why his goal is not realistic, (2) why his solution isn't realistic, and (3) what a reasonable compromise could be.
1) Software always will have bugs. CI only assures that we can build the code, not that it has no bugs. 
2) CI on all existing branches will take ages and is not usefull since there might also be outdated branches. ** Solution: Branches that are under development will likely not pass CI at the end of the day. **
3) Use CI on the main branch and on branches that are under active development. ** Solution: Use CI on branches that represent a product. (i.e. branches of versions). Pull requests failing CI will not be merged into those branches. **
