# Question 2: Code releases

1) Your colleague wants to wait until the next minor release to include a major bugfix instead of making a bugfix
   release. Explain why this is not a good idea.
- This does not comply to the semantic versioning practice where minor releases introduce new features and not bugfixes.
**SOLUTION: does not fit in the changelog, inconvenient for users, bugfix could imply security risks -> fix as fast as
possible **

2) In the process of reworking the architecture of the project, you need to remove a method because it's too easy to use
   incorrectly and there's now an easier-to-use replacement. What changes should you make for upcoming releases?
- This break backward compatibility, hence, we should wait for the next major release. 
**SOLUTION: we can do it if it is a private method. Else first not it ad deprecated and remove it in a following major 
release. **

3) Your project depends on the latest available minor release version of a package instead of a hardcoded exact version,
   what are the pros and cons of this?
- Pros: we don't have to update our code if a bugfix is released. Cons: we could update *by accident* to a newer major
version of the package that breaks some features of our code. **SOLUTION: the answer is wrong because we only update 
to the current minor version. However, this can still cause the code to run differently.**
