# Legacy code

You are working on a legacy codebase for a publicly released library that has
been around for a while, and are tasked to modernize it. In particular, your team
has noticed that a lot of functions return `java.util.Collection` objects, which
eagerly compute their contents, and wants to replace them with lazily computed
`java.util.stream.Stream` sequences. One of your colleagues suggests updating
the library to replace all the `java.util.Collection` return types, and publish
a new major version of the library. What are you thoughts on this?

I would first introduce the newer methods and mark the older ones as deprecated, then remove the older ones at some time.
The issue is that this will break a lot of code of people that use the code. 
**SOLUTION: keep the older methods for a while because they require little maintenace if implemented trough a wrapper 
around the newer methods. **
