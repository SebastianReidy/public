You want to create an application that allows users to manage their e-books. These books will be stored in a local
database, with attributes like name, file, etc. In addition, your application will allow to add notes on books, which
will be stored separately in the database, and to send a book with its notes by e-mail to friends, who can import
the book and the notes in the app.

What modules would you define? How will they be put together to form an application in a clean way?
- DB interface
- DB books implements DB interface
  - handles the storage of all books 
- DB notes implements DB interface 
  - handles all notes made by users
- ViewModel handling all the requests / fetching books & notes from the DBs, sending notes to others, providing data 
to the view. 
- View handling the UI 

**SOLUTION: lowest level DB & sending emails used by a sharing function, books and notes modules. On top of that a view
model and a UI on top of the view model.**
