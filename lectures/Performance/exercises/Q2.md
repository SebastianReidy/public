While working on a new feature for your team's product, your colleague is
required to write a function that takes a list of events and sorts them by
their timestamp. Using their algorithm course knowledge, they remind you
that [merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)'s complexity
is `O(n log n)`, which is better than the `O(n^2)` worst-case complexity
of [quick sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort), and that they will
therefore use the former to solve their task. What do you think of your
colleague's approach?

> The colleague should also consider other sorting algorithms. Furthermore, he should all algorithms, including those 
> with a worse Landau notation running time. In fact, inside the O(...) there could be very large constants hiding slowing
> down the computation of the the result for smaller n's. 
> 
> **SOLUTION: the colleague should run benchmarks for various sized inputs**
