The Java programming language offers a rich set of features that can be used to implement a wide
variety of applications. However, the language also suffers from a number of problems that can
make it difficult to use. Here are two examples:

- [`java.lang.Cloneable`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Cloneable.html)
  is an unusual interface. Why is this problematic?

> The interface is called clonable but does not contain a clone method. 

- [`java.util.Stack`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Stack.html)
  has a surprising inheritance hierarchy. Additionally, the `search` method uses a particular
  convention for its return value. What is the main "surprise" this method could give to a
  developer who is experienced with other parts of the Java standard library?

> It inherits from collections. Collections provide operations like search which make no sense to perform on a stack.
> Furthermore, the search method starts with index 1!!!! **The class should use vector as an implementation detail, not 
> inherit from it.**
