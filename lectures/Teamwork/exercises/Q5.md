# Code Review

In a typical collaborative software development workflow, code must be peer reviewed before being integrated. This
usually takes the form of a pull request review on a git hosting service (e.g. Github). This insures the quality of the
code in terms of following the best practices and conventions set by the team.

As a code review exercise:

1) Please fork the
   following [repository](https://github.com/sweng-epfl/code-review) ([GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)):

    - Click on the `Fork` button at the top right of the page. 
    - Uncheck the box that says `copy the main branch only`.
    - Click on the `Create fork` button.

> This will redirect you to your newly created/forked repository under your namespace.

2) Create a new pull request to merge the changes from the branch `feature/order-service` to the main
   branch ([GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)):
    - Click on the `Pull requests` tab, and then on the `New pull request` button.
    - Set the base branch to `main` and the compare branch to `feature/order-service`.

3) Add a friend as a collaborator to your
   repository ([GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)):
    - Click on the `Settings` tab of your repository on top right, then on the `Collaborators` tab on the left.
    - Click on the `Add people` button in the middle of the page.

4) Perform a review on your friend's pull request (smelly code, performance optimization, bugs,
   etc..) ([GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews)).

5) Merge your pull request ([GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request)):
   - Click on the button `Merge pull request` at the bottom of the pull request page.
