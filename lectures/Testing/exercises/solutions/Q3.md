# Evaluation criteria

- The answer should make it possible to have automated tests for the module
- The answer should be based on the usefulness of each dependency, and avoid unnecessary
  dependencies that could be implementation details


# Suggested s solution

Depending on a weather service and a hiking trail listing service is a good idea.

However, the function that sorts the hiking trails by length should not be a dependency. In fact,
this function is a "pure" function that could be an implementation detail; there is only one valid
implementation possible.

Furthermore, the module should depend on a geolocation service to filter the hiking trails based on
their proximity to the user, as the module specification requires.

Alternatively, the module could depend on a hiking trail prioritization strategy, and the module
could then be used with several strategy implementations such as one that prioritizes length and
one that prioritizes proximity. These strategy implementations may themselves internally depend
on some other services (for instance, the geolocation service) which would then not need to be
provided as dependencies to the module.
