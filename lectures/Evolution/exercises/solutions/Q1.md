# Evaluation Criteria

- Differentiating between source and binary compatibility
- Having a correct explanation

# Proposed Solution

1) Changing the signature of a public method will break the binary compatibility, as existing compiled code refers to
   the method using a void-returning signature. Without recompiling the code that uses this methode, we will be getting
   a `NoSuchMethodError` even if this code is source compatible indeed. Meaning, source compatibility does not imply
   binary compatibility.

2) Changing the signature of a private method does not break compatibility, since nobody else could call it.

3) Changing the parameter type from `int` to its wrapper class `Integer` will break the binary compatibility for the
   reasons explained previously, but it remains source compatible thanks to Java's autoboxing capability.
