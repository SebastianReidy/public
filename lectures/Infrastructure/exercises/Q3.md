You've been hired to modernize a codebase from a 50-year-old company: version control, automated builds, and continuous integration.

One of your colleagues, who is not completely up-to-date with modern practices, asks you three questions:

> Shouldn't we minimize the number of source files, to make it easier to call the compiler on the command line?
- No, this would kill modularity, hence the readability of the code. We can easily use a build tool to build all files with one command. 

> Does adding "continuous integration" mean we no longer need to worry about testing?
- CI only builds the code. We should still do testing. ** Solution: CI can do code analysis / automated testing but the testcases have to be written by developers. There is no automated testing. **

> Do I have to do one "commit" each day with my day's work?
- No, you should do one commit for every bugfix / new feature. ** Solution: Commit = one logical change, this does not relate to the time worked on an issue ** 

Explain to your colleague why the answer is no for all three questions.
