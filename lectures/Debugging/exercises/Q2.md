You are writing an implementation for the following function:

```
/** Find the N-th percentile of the array of values provided, e.g., 50% = median, 100% = maximum */
int findPercentile(int[] values, int n)
```

Which pre-conditions should this method have?
To facilitate debugging, you decided to add a post-condition: the returned value must be in the array `values`.
However, one of your colleagues notices that the post-condition requires to iterate the whole array, and does not agree
because this function will be used frequently in a code whose latency must be minimized. What compromise would you
suggest? What are its pros and cons?

A precondition for this function is that the ``n`` variable needs to be in [0,100]. The array should be nonempty
or we should specify that we return null in this case. A compromise would be to check the index of the returned 
value to be in the range of [0, lengthOfArray]. This leaves us with an overhead of also computing the index and which 
is less than traversing the array again. However, it doesn't give us 100% security because we can still return the array
value of another index. 

**SOLUTION: check lenght of the array to be > 0. Array should not be null. Better compromise: Only do the test in debug 
builds and not in release builds. This will make the release code harder to debug.**
