# Question 3 [15 points]

Users report that your app freezes when they access its image gallery, which shows images in a scrollable grid.
This is the function run to display the gallery:
```java
void startImageGallery() {
    // Download all the user's images from the application server
    List<Image> images = getImages();
    // Display the first few images
    displayImage(images);
    // Initialize the behavior of the exit button, back button, zoom button, etc.
    startComponentBehavior();
}
```

In one sentence, explain why the application is freezing:

> The code synchronously downloads images, thus the app will freeze until the download is over


Users complain that your app's image gallery uses too much of their mobile data.
In one sentence, explain the first step towards improving this:

> The app could stream images rather than batch them, to only download images the user actually sees


In the daily standup, you mention you are having issues with JavaFX.
Before you can give more details, your team's JavaFX expert tells you to leave it at that and instead pass by her office afterwards.
The Scrum Master disagrees and asks you to give more details.
In one sentence, explain whether your Scrum Master is taking the right approach and why.

> No, this will force other members to sit through an explanation that's not relevant to them, the colleague was right
