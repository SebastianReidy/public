One of your colleagues has just fixed a bug reported by a user.
Your colleague thinks about writing a test after having fixed the bug to prevent it from reappearing, and asks you for your opinion.

What should you tell your colleague?
- The colleague should undo his bugfix, e.g. going back to a previous version of the repo with git. Then he should write a test for the bug. In this way we can be sure that we found and reproduced the bug if this test fails. Then he can apply the bugfix again and check if it works. The new tests should be added to the existing set of tests such that this bug will not reapear in previous versions.
