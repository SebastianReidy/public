# Evaluation criteria

- The answer modifies only the `WeatherService` class as required
- The answer uses dependency injection
- The tests have descriptive naming
- The tests have good coverage


# Suggested solution

The code we provide you instantiates its own dependencies. This is problematic for multiple reasons:

- Your tests may fail because of factors outside your control; for instance, testing a class that gets data from the Web may
  fail if the Internet connection is down for any reason.
- It may be impractical to simulate some failure cases; for instance, if you want to test what happens when a Web server
  is down, your tests would have to run when it really is down, which is hard to predict.
- Your test may change the state of the external service, in a way that is not recoverable, e.g., delete a user. You
  would not want your tests to wreak havoc in your production database!

We will change the code to use _dependency injection_ instead.
Instead of instantiating the objects and services that a class depends on, i.e., its "dependencies",
a class should receive them as parameters to its constructor, i.e., get them "injected".
Those dependencies should be _interfaces_, not specific implementations.

## Dependency Injection
```java
class WeatherService {
    private final HttpClient httpClient;

    public WeatherService() {
        this.httpClient = new RealHttpClient();
    }

    public WeatherService(HttpClient httpClient) {
        this.httpClient = httpClient;
    }

    public Weather getWeatherToday() {  /*... omitted for brevity ...*/}
}
```

In this way, the class can be used without providing constructor parameters, but you can also inject the dependencies
during testing.

## Example Tests

```Java
public final class WeatherServiceTest {
    @Test
    void getWeatherTodayWithValidWeatherIsCorrect() {
        HttpClient httpClient = url -> "Sunny";
        WeatherService weatherService = new WeatherService(httpClient);
        assertThat(weatherService.getWeatherToday(), is(Weather.SUNNY));
    }

    @Test
    public void getWeatherTodayWithInvalidWeatherIsCorrect() {
        HttpClient httpClient = url -> "invalid_weather";
        WeatherService weatherService = new WeatherService(httpClient);
        assertThat(weatherService.getWeatherToday(), is(Weather.UNKNOWN));
    }

    @Test
    public void getWeatherTodayReturnsUnknownOnException() {
        HttpClient httpClient = url -> {
            throw new IOException();
        };
        WeatherService weatherService = new WeatherService(httpClient);
        assertThat(weatherService.getWeatherToday(), is(Weather.UNKNOWN));
    }
}
```
