# Q0.2a : Displaying stories

We will kickstart your career as an Android software engineer by creating an application which
displays a list of news stories. Each story will have a headline and a URL.

## Creating the news list

First, you need to create a list of news stories. To do this, we will be using an Android view
called `RecyclerView`. This view is a container for displaying large data sets that can be scrolled
very efficiently by reusing a limited number of views. It is a very powerful view and you will be
using it a lot in your career as an Android developer.

To create a `RecyclerView`, you need to add a `RecyclerView` to your layout file. You can do this by
editing `app/res/layout/activity_main.xml` as follows:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:id="@+id/container"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context=".MainActivity">

    <androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
        android:id="@+id/news_list"
        android:layout_width="0dp"
        android:layout_height="0dp"
        app:layoutManager="androidx.recyclerview.widget.LinearLayoutManager"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />

</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```

This will add a `RecyclerView` to your layout. You will notice that we have also added
a `layoutManager`
attribute to the `RecyclerView`. This attribute is used to specify the layout manager that will be
used to position the items in the `RecyclerView`. A layout manager is responsible for measuring and
positioning items within a `RecyclerView`. There are many different layout managers available, but
for now we will use the `LinearLayoutManager` which will position the items in a vertical list.

Note that we have also added an `id` attribute to the `RecyclerView`. This is used to reference the
`RecyclerView` from our code.

Launch your app. You will notice that the screen is blank. This is because we have not added any
items to the `RecyclerView`. We will do this in the next step.

## Preparing our news list

To display items in the `RecyclerView`, we need to create an adapter. An adapter is a bridge between
a `RecyclerView` and the underlying data for that view. The adapter provides access to the data
items. The adapter is also responsible for providing a `View` for each currently visible item in the data set.

To create an adapter, we will first create a class which represents a single item in the list. This
class will be called `Story`, and may for instance be defined as follows:

```java
public class Story {

    public final int id;
    public final String title;
    public final String url;

    public Story(int id, String title, String url) {
        this.id = id;
        this.title = title;
        this.url = url;
    }

    // Don't forget to implement equals() and hashCode()!
}
```

Then, we can create the adapter. This adapter will be called `StoriesAdapter`. It will be a subclass
of `ListAdapter` which is a convenience class for presenting lists of data in a `RecyclerView`.

```java
public final class StoriesAdapter extends ListAdapter<Story, StoriesAdapter.ViewHolder> {

    public StoriesAdapter() {
        super(new StoryItemCallback());
    }

    @NonNull
    @Override
    public ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(@NonNull ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
        var inflater = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext());
        return new ViewHolder(inflater.inflate(android.R.layout.simple_list_item_2, parent, false));
    }

    @Override
    public void onBindViewHolder(@NonNull ViewHolder holder, int position) {
        holder.title.setText(getItem(position).title);
        holder.subtitle.setText(getItem(position).url);
    }

    public static class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
        private final TextView title;
        private final TextView subtitle;

        public ViewHolder(View itemView) {
            super(itemView);
            title = itemView.findViewById(android.R.id.text1);
            subtitle = itemView.findViewById(android.R.id.text2);
        }
    }
}

public final class StoryItemCallback extends DiffUtil.ItemCallback<Story> {

    @Override
    public boolean areItemsTheSame(@NonNull Story oldItem, @NonNull Story newItem) {
        return oldItem.id == newItem.id;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean areContentsTheSame(@NonNull Story oldItem, @NonNull Story newItem) {
        return oldItem.equals(newItem);
    }
}

```

The adapter is responsible for creating a `ViewHolder` for each item in the list. The `ViewHolder`
is a wrapper around a `View` which is used to display a single item in the list. The adapter will
reuse the `ViewHolder` for multiple items in the list.

The `onCreateViewHolder` method is called when a new `ViewHolder` needs to be created. In this
example, we use an existing layout from the Android framework called `simple_list_item_2` with two
text fields.

In `onBindViewHolder`, we bind the data from the `Story` to the `ViewHolder`. In this example, we
simply set the title and URL of the story to the text fields in the `ViewHolder`.

Finally, we provide a `DiffUtil.ItemCallback` which is used to determine whether two items in the
list are the same. This is used to optimize the `RecyclerView`'s `ListAdapter` by only updating the
items that have changed.

## Displaying the items

Now, we need to set the adapter on the `RecyclerView`. We can do this in the `onCreate` method of
our `MainActivity`:

```java
public final class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        RecyclerView recyclerView = findViewById(R.id.news_list);
        var adapter = new StoriesAdapter();

        recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter);

        // Display a bunch of stories.
        adapter.submitList(generateStories());
    }


    private static List<Story> generateStories() {
        return List.of(
                new Story.Builder().id(0).title("title 0").url("https://epfl.ch").build(),
                new Story.Builder().id(1).title("title 1").url("https://epfl.ch").build(),
                new Story.Builder().id(2).title("title 2").url("https://epfl.ch").build(),
                new Story.Builder().id(3).title("title 3").url("https://epfl.ch").build());
    }
}
```

We use the `id` attribute of the `RecyclerView` that we defined earlier to find the `RecyclerView`
in the layout. Then, we set the adapter on the `RecyclerView`. Finally, we generate a list of
stories and submit it to the adapter.

Run the app again. This time, you should see a list of stories displayed on the screen!
