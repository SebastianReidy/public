# Question 1 [11 points]

You are working in a company on the back-end of a mobile application.


Your code crashes with a `MaxSpotFleetRequestCountExceeded` error.
Who is your web service provider?

> Amazon Web Services (as can be found by looking up the error name)


One colleague explains that the team had originally configured the repo so that only code with >80% path coverage
could be merged, but have now dropped this requirement.
In one sentence, give one possible reason behind this removal.

> Real-world code typically has too many paths to feasibly cover, e.g., because there are too many "if" conditions, or potentially-infinite loops.


You are tasked with improving the integration of the authentication via Google in your app, but your manager tells you:
```
Don't run any tests today, we only have a few API calls left for today's rate limit, we need to preserve those for customers.
```
In 1-2 sentences, propose a change to the codebase to avoid this problem.

> The code should use dependency injection so that tests can mock the services instead of using the real ones.
