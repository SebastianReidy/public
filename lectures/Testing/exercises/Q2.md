The company in which you work has just hired a new CTO, freshly graduated from a theoretical university.

The CTO decides that in order to minimize bugs in the product, all new code must now be covered at least 80% in terms of paths in the code.

Is this a good idea, and why? Can you suggest something better, given the CTO's objective?
- Under this constraint, the company will not deploy any more software because todays software is to complex to allow path coverages of 80%. I would suggest to use branch testing as a metric. Then we can be sure that at least every branch of code has been excecuted once. In the lecture we saw as an example that even small software requires more tests than there are atoms in the galaxy to reach a path coverage of 100%. 

** one could also argue that if there is an infinite loop somewhere in the code this objective will never be reached **
