**Practical exercises**:

- [Capture the flag](ctf/)


**Ideas for your own projects**:

- Follow user inputs throughout your code and see whether any of them are persisted or displayed to users without sanitization
- Set up a way to regularly update your dependencies, such as Dependabot on GitHub
- Check out the [CWE Top 25](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25), and how they could apply to your project
