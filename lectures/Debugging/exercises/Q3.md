You are chatting during lunch break with a colleague who complains about the time she spent to find the cause of a bug:
>The error actually came from our "optimized" version of array sorting! Due to an "off-by-one" calculation in the sorting
logic, the result was not sorted correctly. The rest of the application assumes that the array is sorted, so the coefficient
calculated by module X was negative, which should never happen. Module Y was therefore calculating absurd results, which were
then used by module Z to make requests to our server, which therefore failed with an "invalid input" exception.

What can you suggest to this colleague so that she spends less time next time? Is it possible to get some of the
advantages of your solution with only some of the disadvantages, or is it an "all or nothing" solution?

She should build in assertions in her code at points where values are easy to check. For example the negative value
at module X can be checked easy with one if clause followed by an IllegalArgumentException. Like this she knows that the 
error happens before module X and only has to look for errors there. Maybe she could also inserted an Exception in module 
Y if the 'absurde' values are easy to detect. Assertions come with the cost of additional code. However, this is totally 
negligible if it is just checking for a negative value. 

**SOLUTION: we can check with assertions that the array is sorted indeed. However, this comes with additional cost.**
