# Backward Compatibility

Your team is discussing the following code:

```java
public final class DataStructure {
    public void add(int val) { /*...*/ }

    private boolean isFull() { /*...*/ }
}
```

1) One of your colleagues suggests that `add` should be changed to return a boolean indicating whether the passed value
   was added or not. Explain whether this breaks backward compatibility and why or why not (without worrying about
   whether this is a good or a bad thing).

> Breaks backward binary compatibility because the signature of the method changes. It breaks not the source compatibility
> because the method can still be used in the same way. 

2) Another colleague thinks that `isFull` should be made public. Explain whether this breaks backward compatibility
   and why or why not (also without worrying about whether this is a good or a bad thing)

> Breaks nothing since the users couldn't use the private method before. 

3) They were thinking as well of changing the parameter type of `add` to an `Integer`. Explain whether this breaks
   backward compatibility and why or why not (also without worrying about whether this is a good or a bad thing).

> This breaks the binary compatibility since the signature of the method changes. However, it is still source backward 
> compatible because Integer is a wrapper of int. **SOLUTION: works because of autoboxing / unboxing of the java compiler**
