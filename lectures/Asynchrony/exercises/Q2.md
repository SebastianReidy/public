# Concurrency vs. Parallelism

You have been working with a friend on a LinkedIn-like app, where a user can lookup the shortest path to another 
user on the platform. You currently have two issues, the operation of finding a path sometimes takes a considerable 
amount of time, and it freezes the app in the process. Your friend suggests to run this operation concurrently with 
the main thread, he says it's going to speed up the duration of the operation and will stop the freezes.

Your friend suggestion will actually only fix one of the two problems, can you tell which one is it and why?

>> This will only avoid freezing the UI all the time. However, it still takes roughly the same amount of time until a 
> path is found. 
> 
> SOLUTION: concurrently does not mean in parallel because there are single CPU systems. On a single CPU the code will 
> run even longer because the system has to switch between the threads.
