You are a new developer working on a 3D game engine, _Anarchy3D_.
You are tasked with writing the class representig a 3D vector.

In the class' documentation, write the specification for the `Vector3` class in informal language.

This class should have at least the following capabilities:
- check if the vector is the zero vector
- compute the dot product with another vector
- compute the length of the vector
- compute the cross product with another vector
- normalize the vector
- scale the vector by a scalar

You are free to add any other functionality that you see fit.
You can also use formal language, i.e., mathematical formulas, if required.
Think about the edge cases when designing the specification and how they should be handled.

Then, implement the `Vector3` class using TDD. You are free to add any methods and classes that you like.
