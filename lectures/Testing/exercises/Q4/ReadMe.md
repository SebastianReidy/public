You must take on the work left by a sick colleague.

This code implements a weather client, for a weather server that is being developed.
One of your colleagues is also developing an HTTP client module.

Your task is to:
- Modify only the `WeatherService` class to be able to test it despite the absence of a server and the non-functional HTTP code
- Test the `WeatherService` class
