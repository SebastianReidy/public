# Test-Driven Development

You can find the proposed implementation of the vector class
in [`Vector3.java`](src/main/java/Vector3.java).
Note that this is only one of the many ways to implement this class.

The tests associated with the implementation can be found
in [`Vector3Test.java`](src/test/java/Vector3Test.java).
