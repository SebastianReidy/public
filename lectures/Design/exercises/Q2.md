The Java programming language offers a rich set of features that can be used to implement a wide
variety of applications. However, the language also suffers from a number of problems that can
make it difficult to use. Here are two examples:

- [`java.lang.Cloneable`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Cloneable.html)
  is an unusual interface. Why is this problematic?
  - Its called clonable but does not contain the clone method. It is not possible to clone an object implementing clonable 
- merely by the fact that it implements this interface. 
- [`java.util.Stack`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Stack.html)
  has a surprising inheritance hierarchy. Additionally, the `search` method uses a particular
  convention for its return value. What is the main "surprise" this method could give to a
  developer who is experienced with other parts of the Java standard library?
  - The search method returns the 1-based position where an object is on this stack. Java is zero based. **SOLUTION: the
class inherits from vector witch means that we can do vector operations on a stack. The vector should be an implementation 
detail hidden from the users.**
