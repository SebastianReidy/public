You are working on a text editor written in Java. Your colleague is
interested in optimizing a wrapper around `String.substring()` used to let
users copy and paste parts of the text and decides to write some benchmarks to
measure the current performance of the feature. How would you suggest that he
proceeds?
- I suggest him to also look at the latency distribution including the percentiles after repeating operations on the
wrapper multiple times. Furthermore, he should consider various length inputs as users might want to copy various length
strings.

**SOLUTION: input string distribution should resemble the real life distribution. Implementation af String.substring is 
O(n), hence we expect higher latency for long strings.**
