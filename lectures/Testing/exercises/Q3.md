Your colleague wants your opinion on a module design question.
They are developing a service that recommends hikes near users based on the weather,
and they think the module should take as input a weather service, a service that lists hikes,
a function that sorts hikes by length, and outputs an array of hikes.

What do you think?
I think this is a good idea because like this we can design test cases for the service using different weather conditions / list of hikes etc. 

**The last one is not a dependency because it is a pure function. I.e. a function that has a deterministic result. In addition geolocation services could be usefull to calculate the distances to the next hike.**
