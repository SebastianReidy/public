# Code releases

1) Your colleague wants to wait until the next minor release to include a major bugfix instead of making a bugfix
   release. Explain why this is not a good idea.

> The bug could be exploited for an attack - fixing bugs as fast as possible is security relevant. If the code contains a 
> bug it is unconvenient for customers. 
> **SOLUTION: not customer friendly since some want to just apply the bugfix without updating to the latest version**

2) In the process of reworking the architecture of the project, you need to remove a method because it's too easy to use
   incorrectly and there's now an easier-to-use replacement. What changes should you make for upcoming releases?

> Mark the method as deprecated and show a warning if a user uses the method with the text that it will be removed in a future 
> release. **SOLUTION: if backwards compatibility persistis we could release it in a minor release**

3) Your project depends on the latest available minor release version of a package instead of a hardcoded exact version,
   what are the pros and cons of this?

> Pros, the package is always up to date with the latest bugfixes. Cons, the code could be broken through auto updating 
> because even if the minor releases should be backwards compatible they are not always in practice.
