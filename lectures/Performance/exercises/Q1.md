You are working on a text editor written in Java. Your colleague is
interested in optimizing a wrapper around `String.substring()` used to let
users copy and paste parts of the text and decides to write some benchmarks to
measure the current performance of the feature. How would you suggest that he
proceeds?

> First, he should use a profiler to evaluate if this part of the code is slowing down the program significantly. If not, 
> there is no need for optimization of this function. After that, he should consider multiple iterations of the function 
> and also consider the warmup of the java compiler. 
> 
> **SOLUTION: the colleague should consider real word examples(long enough). Then he would detect that the method is in 
> fact O(n) and not O(1)**
